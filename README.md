# Predicting-credit-worthiness-of-loan-applicants

Introduction
Credit and default risks have been an area of concern for banking and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) ever since the introduction of the concept of loaning money in exchange for a market driven time value of money in form of interest. This problem has come to the forefront since the subprime mortgage crisis that culminated to into a global recession in 2008. In the aftermath of the crisis, people realized that one of the main causes of that crisis was that financial institutions granted loans freely to people without properly examining customers risk profile. An inferior risk modelling technique meant that financial institutes got their risk appetite calculations completely wrong leading to losses or in some cases bankruptcy. To prevent this from happening again, financial institutions turned in to the concept of Credit risk modelling to assess the credit risk of individuals and corporation more accurately.
Our research aims to study the existing work in this field and find ways to improve the modelling algorithm so that businesses can make better decisions. Our goal is to estimate the probability that a potential customer applying for a loan will experience delinquency beyond 30 days or default on his/her financial commitments to the company. Based on this probability, we plan to classify customers in different risk buckets so that a company is aware of the risk of acquiring a customer and can relate the overall risk potential to its risk appetite. While our research uses analysis from publicly available data of a company named Lending Club, we believe that the designed model can be used in other sectors and companies where some form of financial risk grading is involved.


Data Source:
Our main data source is the dataset floated by a peer to peer lending company called as LendingClub (Dataset). The base dataset contained 1,321,864 observations with 111 variables. On this dataset, we have added variables like Median Income and Poverty which would give us an indication of the effects of macroeconomic factors on the default rate.
